The code represents an intuitive example of the Observer pattern. The example is provided by Christopher Okhravi (https://www.youtube.com/c/ChristopherOkhravi). 
Suppose we have a weather station (observable). Some devices (observers), which are subscribed to this weather station, display the temperature. Whenever a temperature is 
changed, devices are notified, and they display the updated temperature.
P.S. Check the UML diagram.
